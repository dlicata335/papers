Every type former has a polarity, either positive or negative.

Positive types are types defined by their introduction rules (e.g. (higher)
inductive types). The elimination rule of a positive type $I$ is an eliminator
which gives an inhabitant of any glob over $I$ given an inhabitant over every
constructor. The $\beta$ computation rules states that applying the eliminator
to a constructor gives the correct stuff. There is an additional computation
rule which says that the eliminator commutes with coherences.  \FIXME{What is
  $\eta$?}

Negative types are types defined by their elimination rules (e.g. coinductive
types, records, Pi, universe). The introduction rule of a negative type $P$
gives an inhabitant of an arbitrary glob in $P$ given inhabitants of the
$\dsd{Ap}$ of the elimination rules on the glob. The $\beta$ computation rules
state that applying one of the elimination rules to the introduction rule gives
the correct stuff. The $\eta$ computation rule says that one of the introduction
rules applied to the application of the eliminator to an element of the correct
glob gives back the same element. There is an additional computation rule which
says that coherences are defined pointwise.

Here are the rules for various type formers.
